      <p> In our daily life we live in a <i>normalized corruption era</i>. But,
        for supplying our needs while preventing corruption, we can get
        organized in liquid restructuring (of the legal bodies via which we are
        normally interacting).</p>
      <p>From here we are creating<em> colorful decentralized and liquid</em>
        self organized organizations arising in our global HopeIsBack
        Foundations Network, where each foundation may contribute only to <em><strong>humanitarian
            solutions based on the beneficial movement of people between groups
            in which they have equal power</strong>: </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>These organizations are structured <em>to <strong>prevent
              corruption</strong></em>, when <em>keeping diversity</em> of <strong>all</strong>
          minorities with the non-voters and the majority, while building their
          <em><strong>critical mass for realizing their need</strong></em>.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The financing is made only proportional, without letting any
            winner to take all, while benefiting individuals, in and between
            their groups, for their participation, while they are consuming,
            naturally and with low learning curve.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      We, <b>the HopeIsback NetWork</b>, are now in the opening phase of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_%28nonprofit%29"
        target="_blank">localizing</a> HopeIsBack foundations, which are the
      self organized economic structuring aspect of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hopeisback"
        target="_blank">#HopeIsBack</a>. The foundations <b>are providing,
        while consulting for</b>, solutions made for the brave ones who know
      their difficulties and lost their hope, but are able to gain it back. The
      statute of each foundation is:
      <ul>
        <li>This foundation may contribute only to <b>humanitarian solutions
            based on the beneficial movement of people between groups in which
            they have equal power</b>.
          <ul>
            <li> The HopeIsBack’s board of directors may add solutions to Its 6
              initial solutions being:
              <ul>
                <li>the <a href="#comcomized" target="_top">comcomized
                    agreement</a> of equal ownership (designed to avoid taking
                  over by the huge corporations, while giving a room for
                  cooperating with some "normal" business making)- ere are some
                  example of concrete solutions: "connecting people" is
                  something owned by them and not by huge company as facebook,
                  convincing the citizens to participate in green energy
                  campaign as green companies owners or making any
                  bailout/privatization cycle with the citiznes as players
                  instead of the few huge companies, </li>
                <li>the <a href="#LiquidUnin" target="_top">Liquid union model</a>
                  of fair distribution (compared with
                  liquid/delegative-democracy telling how to decide and produce
                  or serve, liquid union is about how to get organized to get
                  and choose between services and products) - <b>An ex:</b> the
                  national citizens payment for tv station can be made for
                  liquid union having projects such as entertainment,
                  investigation, education, culture, art-development, etc, where
                  each of which projects has its channels financed proportional
                  to number of participants in the channel, so that also the
                  voices of minorities and non-voter would be heard too,</li>
                <li>the <a target="_top" href="#Qdolphin">Qdolphin browser</a>,
                  A browser for smart people developed confined providing
                  progressive web app user experience configured by qt/qml with
                  encryption feature: 3fish1kbit in ctr mode by contextual kdf2
                  key, producing 4k files, each having different strong key
                  strengthening the weakest ring of any security chain being the
                  human passcode,</li>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is all made for <b>solving</b> problems raised because of
              the exponential increase of movement of products, services,
              capital, money and of information, while blocking people - <b>a
                global problematic phenomenos producing higher passivity or
                aggression and more wars</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Why liquid? Think of the these 3 qualities of water: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Transparency - transmitting information to all its parts instantly,
          in a wave;</li>
        <li> Acumulativeness - flowing around obstacles to get together and</li>
        <li> Decentralization (single failure point immunization) - moving some
          (drops) of it do not hunt the rest. </li>
      </ul>
      How to decentralize:
      <ul>
        <li>in each foundation to incubate temporal projects each is liquid
          union or comcomized unit, but only for predefined time and then
          contracting with their form legal body in thier region. </li>
      </ul>
      How to course solidarity in liquid unions:
      <ul>
        <li> by comparing per each project their budget/number-of-participants ,
          then comparing the irregularities (from median or average) of
          projects, then limiting the irregularities, with defining exception by
          the need of the union defined in its policies. </li>
      </ul>
      How to course accountability when hiring manager ceo etc:
      <ul>
        <li> when giving any percentage giving it only some times*cycle after
          the cycle of profit of her/his plan which is to be cheeked by
          accountable trustees while until then he/get only salary. </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>The winner-take-it-all game is the main cause for hate as a conditional
        feeling in group belongness destructively tested by how well "hates our
        competitors for living with us", while the winner takes its proportional
        part game causes attraction based affiliation.</p>

        <p> Our <b>degentrification</b> projects, as gentrification became the
          first world wide city people issue, will offer 2 steps solutions: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> the first step is of liquid unions of which branches are served
            by lawyers and providing storage places, temporal accommodations,
            moving and sharing staff and information centers for renters and </li>
          <li> the second step, which will be triggered after reaching some
            critical mass of participants being also equal share holders in
            their comcomized units, created for lending the necessary money to
            create guaranties for the renters wishing to buy their apartment by
            their renting payments. </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p><b>Rationale:</b> The specialization, as a stand alone value in
          economics, is costly, its efficiency is violent, and its beneficiaries
          for increasingly shorter-terms are in increasingly limited group,
          while this drama of purification processing when increasing value
          (which is wrongly named growth) creates slavery and addictions, it is
          only good for corrupting imperialistic domination over the world's
          population, that can, and will, be <b>liberated</b> by the <b>decentralization
            and diversification</b>, in liquid structuring restricting, such
          that any budget movements is attached to the movements of the
          corresponding people between groups in which they have equal power. </p>
        <p><b>The hopeisback low cost recruiting</b> is distributed by requiters
          via personal cards, flayers, sticker , (e)mail, etc with the following
          4 elements: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> HopeIsBack network mark or Tm </li>
          <li> F being a mark or Tm of the foundation serving specific subdomain
            in hopeisback </li>
          <li> P being a mark or Tm of the project in the foundation serving
            specific subdomain in comcomized or liquidunions </li>
          <li> X being a requiter number that must be feed in the registration
            to that site (zero for volunteers and optionally with additional
            security measure like another secret code). </li>

            This license of ownership is designed to protect against takeover
            and for building small units holding bigger ones in a recursive
            manner and while keeping mobility and mutuality of their owners.
            Specifically designed against big monopolizing players or pretenders
            only temporally/partly fulfilling the cause of such units. It is
            implemented by each buyer or seller, which must care for the terms
            of this license, where the minimum damage for any owner’s units is
            reflected by the value of the share of the unit.</p>
          <p>A Common company (ComCom) ownership agreement is an agreement of
            ownership between the&nbsp;company’s owners. The agreement, or the
            qualified majority required to change it, is unchangeable. The
            ownership over any part of the ComCom, including any of its asset,
            can be transferred between its owners only under this license:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each owner is either an ordinary owner or a peer owner being
              equal to another peer owner and may only be human or a ComCom;</li>
            <li>Through all holding layers, only a single holding position per
              owner is allowed;</li>
            <li>The&nbsp;ComCom has the first right to buy any ownership over
              itself and each of its owners must match its criteria;</li>
            <li>Per each ComCom, all the peers together equally hold (d) times
              100 percent of the ComCom, such that (v) reflects (m),
              <ul>
                <li>as (d) times (m) equals (c) times (v) or</li>
                <li>as (d) times (i) equals (c) times (n)</li>

                    <li>(n) is the number of shares per each of its peer owner,
                      as (d)&lt;=(n)&lt;=1,</li>
                    <li>(c) is the&nbsp;number of it peer owners, which is to be

                    <li>(i) is number of its issued shares, being also the

              <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>We, the creative class, could embarrass the industries of
                  war by humanitarian licensing, such this humanitarian agpl;</li>
                <li>The Humanitarian agpl (hagpl), as any other Humanitarian
                  open source (hos) code, puts the 5th criteria, "No
                  Discrimination Against Persons or Groups", a condition for the
                  6th one, "No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor" and
                  hence forbids any discrimination between people by the use of
                  such code.</li>
                <li>The <em>knife-tank killing case</em>: a non-humanitarian,
                  usual and repeated argument tells that the use of knife is
                  dual, for buttering - a humanitarian one, but also a non
                  humanitarian use to kill people, but the case of (the vehicle)
                  tank having in its specification being better in killing
                  people is not "also humanitarian" as putting butter on the
                  bread. Thus, in developing a humanitarian code from such
                  knife, the tank application would already become forbidden.</li>
                <li><em>Stopping wars cannot be made by constantly adding wars</em>,
                  but by fighting the industry producing its weapons, an
                  industry which must have all unique things under its control,
                  a condition which is fully dependent on any one's creativity,
                  a case which developing under humanitarian code can prevent.</li>
                <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele">Josef
                      Mengele</a> ones, please stop hacking people</em>:
                  Arguments putting the freedom to learn by doing and the add to
                  knowledge above any other values can only be accepted as
                  Pseudo Religious by Agents or Angels of Death, especially
                  nowadays, when in larger areas machines are able to be more
                  competitive than human.</li>
                <li>Humanitarian open source can at-least embarrass or become
                  more costly for the NSA in its Unnecessary and
                  Disproportionate habit to Violates International Human Rights
                  Standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual licensing option:</strong> "If you hold the
                  humanitarian values specified above and only when the code
                  contains agpl compatible licensed code, you may use this code
                  under agpl".</li>
              </ul>
              <p style="text-align: center;">At any rate, licensed gpl versus
                agpl, is anachronism allowing closing open source in servers
                farms providing dark services.</p>
