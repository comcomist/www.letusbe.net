                  <div class="fcontent content-inner"><br>
		    In any voting systems, whenever the "abstinent voters" group is bigger than the <i>difference between</i> the "supporters" and the "objectors" groups, <br>
            that system neutralize most of its voters<br>
             and when such voting system is made via representatives in some layers, such neutralization is exponentially increased in each layer. <br><br>
            Hence, in most, if not all, modern voting systems, when the group of any representative's supporters is smaller then of abstinent voters together with the objectors, that <b>representative represents only minority</b> of the voters.  <br> <br>
            
Additionally "rules confusion" can be measured by the <b>confusion factor</b> (<code>c=s/r</code>) of any rule, which equals the number (<code>s</code>) of its subjects upon which the rule is implemented divided by the number (<code>r</code>) of those who read and remember that rule.<br> 
Such confusion is exponentially increased when laws are created faster than understanding it by the subjects upon which such laws are to be implemented.<br><br> This is deliberately and constantly "happening" when lobbies are controlling most of the activities of the law makers while synced with bias of media owned by corporate . <br><br>To overcome such confusion, lobbies must be working less for Corporations or Special Interests Groups and more for critical masses of People owning their own media.

                        about 3. </p>
                      <p> The pollution and debt are linked by the

                        in near to infinite labor and energy environment
                        and hence with minimal or almost zero cost or
                        risk, for such richest alone. </p>
                      <p> As we, the labor and environment are the
                        neglected remainder for those economists aiming
                        or expecting destruction, wars and kind of
                        massive population 'dilution' (as they put it),
                        while still able to ignore the necessity for
                        global inclusive social beneficialness, being
                        measured by systemic distribution of benefits
